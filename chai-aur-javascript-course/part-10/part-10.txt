# STACK MEMORY :
    It is a data structure used to store static data. Static data refers to data whose size is known by the engine during compile time. In JavaScript, static data includes primitive values like strings, numbers, boolean, null, and undefined. A fixed amount of memory is allocated for static data. This process is known as static memory allocation.

# HEAP MEMORY : 
    It is used to store objects and functions in JavaScript. The engine doesnâ€™t allocate a fixed amount of memory. Instead, it allocates more space as required.
